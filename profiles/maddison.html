                <p>I’m a down-to-earth doggie with an eye for fine art. My favorite things in the whole world are paw-painting, sunglasses, and food-art. </p>
               <p> Paw-painting is very similar to what hoomans call finger-painting, but with your paws instead.  My hooman goes to school for art and brings me canvases, so we can paint together. We sit by the fireplace in the evenings and paint while listening to jazz music. I have a special throw-rug that I sit on while painting. I've been using the same throw-rug for a few years and it has become a work-of-art in itself. There are arrays of color splattered all over the weaving. It's really quite pretty. This nightly routine of painting and music is seriously my biggest joy in life.</p>
                <p>My hooman and I both like to wear colored sunglasses. We have a matching pair of pink sunglasses that we wear together oftenn. I call them my le vie en rose glasses, named after my favorite song. La vie en rose means life in pink, so I thought the name was fitting.
                </p>
                <p>Often, I find my hooman in the kitchen when she’s not painting. She is a master toast artist! She even gets special gluten-free toast that dogs can eat, so I get to enjoy her toast masterpieces! She can make all sorts of pictures on toast. Here’s a list of my favorite toast creations in order, number one being my favorite:
